web funtionality:

A company owns a network of dental clinics and you need to design a database for them.
Patients can make appointments to see a dentist at a clinic. Sometimes patients make
appointments without knowing which dentist they are going to see. Dentists assign some
treatments to be done on the patient. The treatments can be executed by dentists or by
dental assistants. Bills are produced to record how much the patients need to pay for the
treatments. One bill can contain the cost of many treatments done in one visit at a clinic.
Besides dentists and dental assistants, there are also receptionists responsible for recording
appointments and for processing the bill payments. 

minimum queries needed to be performed:

a. Get details of all dentists in all the clinics.
b. Get details of all appointments for a given dentist for a specific week.
c. Get details of all appointments at a given clinic on a specific date.
d. Get details of all appointments of a given patient.
e. Get the number of missed appointments for each patient (only for patients who have
missed at least 1 appointment).
f. Get details of all the treatments made during a given appointment.
g. Get details of all unpaid bills. 

website features:

There should be a way to modify the data in your database through your interface. It
should at least be possible to add new patients, schedule new appointments and modify
and delete existing appointments.
There should also be a special feature that would normally be reserved for DBAs: a text
area (probably on a different page) in which a user can type an SQL statement and
execute it on the database. Results of the executed statement should be displayed in a
logical way. 

non functional requirement:

clear web UI to perform desired actions,
should not take more than 30 seconds to fully understand how to use web application without assistance
