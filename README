--------- temporary DB being used while the school is closed:

http://www.phpmyadmin.co/
Server: 	sql9.freemysqlhosting.net
Name: 			sql9331940
Username: 		sql9331940
Password: 	ZbhYnScRnZ
Port number: 	3306

---- setup before transfering project to concordia database and server

the database we will be working on will be on phpadmin above
we can use xampp as server, wich apache and mySQL modules
and we can test our work individually on our own computer (local host) from a branch, then merge our work back into github main repository

the reason we are using not working on concordias server and database directly is because
school is closed untill the end of the month and computer unacessible, and using puTTY ssh tunnelling forces us to use prompt commands
to edit/create folders, wich would take forever.
